	<h2>The Life of Rabindranath Tagore</h2>
	<h3>Bibliography</h3>

	<p>Rabindranath Tagore (1861-1941) was the youngest son of Debendranath Tagore, a leader of the Brahmo Samaj, which was a new religious sect in nineteenth-century Bengal and which attempted a revival of the ultimate monistic basis of Hinduism as laid down in the <mark><i>Upanishads</i></mark>. He was educated at home; and although at seventeen he was sent to England for formal schooling, he did not finish his studies there. In his mature years, in addition to his many-sided literary activities, he managed the family estates, a project which brought him into close touch with common humanity and increased his interest in social reforms.</p>

	<p>He also started an experimental school at <mark><kbd>Shantiniketan</kbd></mark> where he tried his Upanishadic ideals of education. From time to time he participated in the Indian nationalist movement, though in his own non-sentimental and visionary way; and Gandhi, the political father of modern India, was his devoted friend. Tagore was knighted by the ruling British Government in 1915, but within a few years he resigned the honour as a protest against British policies in India.</p>

	<h3>A Great Poet and Writer</h3>

	<p>Although Tagore wrote successfully in all literary genres, he was first of all a poet. Among his fifty and odd volumes of poetry are <mark><i>Manasi</i> (1890)</mark> [The Ideal One], <mark><i>Sonar Tari</i> (1894)</mark> [The Golden Boat], <mark><i>Gitanjali</i> (1910)</mark> [Song Offerings], <mark><i>Gitimalya</i> (1914)</mark> [Wreath of Songs], and <mark><i>Balaka</i> (1916)</mark> [The Flight of Cranes]. The English renderings of his poetry, which include <mark><i>The Gardener</i> (1913)</mark>, <mark><i>Fruit-Gathering</i> (1916)</mark>, and <mark><i>The Fugitive</i> (1921)</mark>, do not generally correspond to particular volumes in the original Bengali; and in spite of its title, <mark><i>Gitanjali: Song Offerings</i> (1912)</mark>, the most acclaimed of them, contains poems from other works besides its namesake. Tagore’s major plays are <mark><i>Raja</i> (1910)</mark> [The King of the Dark Chamber], <mark><i>Dakghar</i> (1912)</mark> [The Post Office], <mark><i>Achalayatan</i> (1912)</mark> [The Immovable], <mark><i>Muktadhara</i> (1922)</mark> [The Waterfall], and <mark><i>Raktakaravi</i> (1926)</mark> [Red Oleanders].</p>

	<h3>Not only a Poet, but also a Song Writer</h3>

	<p><b>Tagore Songs</b> make a unique aspect of Rabindranath's creative life. Opinions differ on when he first started composing songs. According to some authorities, his first song was composed when he was 12; some others think that he began composing songs in 1875 at the age of 14. He then composed 'Jval jval chita dvigun dvigun' for the play Sarojini written by his elder brother <kbd>Jyotirindranath Tagore</kbd>. The same year two songs by him appeared in print as offerings for hindu mela. One of them, 'Tomari tare ma sa'pinu e deha' (O mother, this body of mine is dedicated to you), was undisputedly composed by Tagore; but the other, 'Ek sutre bandhiyachhi sahasrati man' (I have tied a thousand minds with one string), is regarded by some as having been composed or set to music by Jyotirindranath Tagore. If 'Tomari tare ma 85' was composed at the age of 12, it was certainly Tagore's first song. For his last birthday he composed 'He nutan, dekha dik ar-bar janmer pratham shubhaksan' (Hail the new, let the auspicious moment of birth appear again) on 7 May 1941. This means he composed songs for 68 years. All his 2,232 songs have been compiled in his Gitabitan.</p>

	<p>Tagore songs are deeply influenced by classical influence. Although he himself did not learn classical music formally, the family atmosphere of cultivating this form of music enables him to compose many of his songs in the Hindustani classical style. On the occasion of Brahma Samaj's Magh festival, he composed many devotional songs in the Hindustani classical style. The Tagore songs composed in this tradition are treasures of our music. Many of his songs abound in the classical forms of sthayi, antara, savchari and abhog. The influence of the classical style is also manifested in the tunes, words and articulation of the songs. During his childhood, several music teachers from the Vishnupur gharana used to come to the Tagore house. Of them, Vishnuchandra Chakravarty and Radhikaprasad Goswami left a deep impression on Tagore's mind. The ragas and raginis heard in his childhood managed to cast long shadows on his songs.One of his peoms in English:</p>

	<pre>
	<q>The song I came to sing
	remains unsung to this day.
	I have spent my days in stringing
	and in unstringing my instrument.

	The time has not come true,
	the words have not been rightly set;
	only there is the agony
	of wishing in my heart…</q></pre>

	 <h3>Other Works of Rabindranath Tagore</h3>
	 <p>In 1901, Tagore’s work as an educator and activist led to his founding an experimental school at <s>Shantinik</s> Shantiniketan, a retreat in rural Bengal that his father created in 1863. There, he hoped to merge Eastern and Western educational traditions. He believed there might be a more <sup>natural way</sup> for young people to learn, utilizing a method which would foster their imagination and instincts. For a time, he lived at the school, which became the <sub>international</sub> Visva-Bharati University. In 1912, Tagore left the school to read his work across Europe, America, and East Asia, and to lecture and advocate for Indian independence.</p>
